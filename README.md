# Disable-JSON-API
Disable the WordPress JSON API for front end users but fix elementor working 

To disable the WordPress JSON API for front-end requests but allow it to load for Elementor, you can achieve this by using a combination of filters and conditions in your theme's functions.php file or in a custom plugin.

The JSON API can be disabled using the rest_authentication_errors filter, which is applied before authentication happens for REST API requests. In the filter, you can add a condition to allow access to the API for requests coming from the Elementor editor.

Here's an example of how you can implement this:

  function disable_json_api_for_frontend($result) {
    // Check if the request is coming from the Elementor editor
    if (defined('ELEMENTOR_VERSION') && (current_user_can('edit_pages') || current_user_can('edit_posts'))) {
        return $result;
    }

    // For all other front-end requests, disable the JSON API
    if (!is_admin()) {
        return new WP_Error('rest_api_disabled', __('The REST API is disabled on this site.'), array('status' => 403));
    }

    return $result;
}
add_filter('rest_authentication_errors', 'disable_json_api_for_frontend');


In the above code, we first check if the constant ELEMENTOR_VERSION is defined, which indicates that Elementor is active on the site. Additionally, we check if the current user has the capabilities to edit pages or posts (edit_pages or edit_posts). If these conditions are met, we allow access to the JSON API, assuming the request is coming from the Elementor editor.

For all other front-end requests (outside of Elementor), we return a 403 Forbidden error, effectively disabling access to the JSON API.

This way, the JSON API will be available for Elementor while being disabled for other front-end requests. Make sure to test the behavior thoroughly after implementing this code to ensure it works as expected in your specific setup.
